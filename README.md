# Langton's ant

### Summary
This project is implementation of Langon's ant which is a two-dimensional universal Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior.

### HowÂ to run the program

The implementation consists of game itself with clipped version and makefile. With using makefile we can run, clear and dict the files. For compiling the game you should only write make command. Then for running the program you should execute the program with arguments width and height, like
```
./langtonant 10 10
```
